        <h2>About Ellie</h2>
        <img src="ellie-slt.png">
        <p class="blurb"> Ellie is currently finishing her last year at Conestoga College in the Advertising and Marketing Communications program. She has a love for graphic design and coming up with interactive ideas and designs, that spread awareness on the effects of EMF and RF radiation. She also has a background in makeup artistry and aesthetics, and has a strong value for creativity. Her favourite part of her job is having the opportunity to get creative while making new videos, booklets, and designs to express the importance of EMF mitigation. Ellie enjoys to spend as much time outdoors as possible; camping and exploring new areas in Northern Ontario. You will likely find her enjoying the day at a local quarry in her spare time.
